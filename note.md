# Kernighan-Lin Algorithm

- It is a **biosectioning** algorithm
    - The input graph is partitioned into two subsets of equal sizes.

- Till the cutsize keeps improving
    - Vertex pairs which give the **largest decrease in cutsize** are exchanged.
    - These vertices are then **locked**
    - If no improvement is possible and some vertices are still unlocked, the vertices which give the smallest increase are exchanged.

- Kernighan-Lin Algorithm  
    - The formula of `gain`: 

        $$D(x, y) = g(x, y) = E_x - I_x + E_y - I_y - 2c(x, y)$$

        , where $E_x$ **is the # of extended neighbors of x**,  
        $I_x$ **is the # of interior neighbors of x**,   
        and $c(x, y)$ **is the # of mutual connected lines between x and y** 

    - **Algorithm KL**
    ```pesudocode
    begin
        INITIALIZE()
        while (IMPROVE(table) == TRUE) do (if and improvement has been made during last iteration, the process is carried out again.)
            while (UNLOCK(A) == TRUE) do (if there exists any unlocked vertex in A, more tentaive exchanges are carried out.)
                for (each a in A) do
                    if (a == unlocked) then
                        for (each b in B) then
                            if (b == unlocked) then
                                if (D_max < D(a) + D(b)) then
                                    D_max = D(a) + D(b)
                                    a_max = a
                                    b_max = b
                TENT-EXCHANGE(a_max, b_max)
                LOCK(a_max, b_max);
                LOG(table)
                D_max = negative infinite
            ACTUAL-EXCHANGE(table)
    end
    ```

- Example
    - Perform single KL pass on the following circuit:
        - KL needs **undirected graph** (**clique-based** weighting)  
            - *a single line represents a weight of 0.5*
            - *a bold line represents a weight of 1*

    - Summary
        - **Cutsize Reduced from 5 to 3**
        - Two best solutions found (solutions are always **area-balanced**)
        - Cutsize: Take look at those images
            - The original Cutsize, look at the image of initial partitioning, and you can found 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 5 edges
            - Cutsize of 1st iteration looks at the second swap's image, and you can found it cuts 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 3 edges
            - Cutsize of 2 iteration looks at the third swap's image, and you can found it cuts 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3 edges
            - Cutsize of 3 iteration looks at the last swap's (a), and you can found it cuts 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 4 edges
            - Custize of 4 iteration looks at the last swap's (b), and you can found it cuts 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5 edges
        - $\Sigma gain(i) = Cutsize_0 - Cutsize_i$ 
        - gain(i) is the select pair's gain.

- Drawbacks of K-L Algorithm
    - considers balanced partitions only
    - As vertices have unit weights, it is not possible to allocate a vertex to a partition
    - considers edges instead of hyperedges
    - High time complexity $O(n^3)$    
    
    
# Fiduccia-Mattheyses Algorithm

- A modified version of Kernighan-Lin Algorithm

- A single vertex is moved across the cut in a single move which **permits handling of unbalanced partitions**

- The concept of cutsize is extended to **hypergraphs**
    - The updated **gain** :
    
        $$\text{gain(x)} = \text{good hyperedges} - \text{bad hyperedges}$$
    
        , where $\text{good hyperedges}: \# \text{ of hyperedges that contain x as the only gate at the other side}$

        $\text{bad hyperedges}: \# \text{ uncut hyperedges that contain x}$

    - **neighbour**: All gates that are contained in the hypergraphs taht contain x

    - The time complexity of calculating a gain for a given vertice is $O(1)$

    - The time complexity of finding the neighhours for a given vertice is also $O(1)$

- Vertices to be moved are selected in a way (**bucket list**) to improve time complexity
    - **bucket lists (priority queues)**
        - Sort nodes by gain within each partition

    ![bucket structure](./images/image_6.png)

- Overall time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^2)$

- Pesudocode
    ```
    Input: 
    - G(V, E): Hypergraph with vertices V and hyperedges E
    - P1, P2: Initial partition of V such that |P1| ≈ |P2|
    - Max_imbalance: Allowed imbalance between partitions

    Output:
    - Improved partition (P1', P2') with minimized edge cut

    Initialize iteration variables:
    - Best_cutsize = Current cutsize
    - Best_move_sequence = []
    - Current_cutsize = Current cutsize
    - Moved_nodes = []
    - create a new bucket list
    - compute gain for each node and put them into bucket list

    Begin
    while there exists unlocked node in the bucket list:
        i. select the highest gain node from non-empty bucket list 
            - ensure the selected node will not exceed allowed imbalance between two partitions
        ii. move the selected node to the other partition
        iii. lock the moved node
        iv. update cutsize and track changes
            - Update Current_cutsize
            - Append move to Moved_nodes
        v. update gain of affected neigbours
            - Recompute gains for adjacent nodes
            - Move them in the bucket list accordingly
        vi. if Current_cutsize < Best_cutsize:
            - Store `Best_cutsize`
            - Store `Best_move_sequence`
    End
    ```

- Example
    - Perform FM algorithm on the following circuit:
        - Area constraint = [3, 5]
            - The maximum imbalance between two sides cannot exceed 2

        - Break ties in alphabetical order

    - **Summary**
        - Found three best solutions

        - Solutions after moving 2 and 4 are better balanced

        |   8   |   c       |   -1      |   0           |   6       |

        - when i = 2 and i = 4, the two sides both have 4 cells, while i = 3, one side has 3 cells and another side has 5 cells.
            - {a, c, e, g} and {b, d, f, h}, {a, b, c, e} and {d, f, h, g} are more balanced than {a, b, c, e, g} and {f, g, h}
